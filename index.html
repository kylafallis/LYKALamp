                    <p>The **LYKA Lamp** is a functional microbial fuel cell (MFC)-powered lighting system that converts energy from the chemical bonds of organic compounds into electrical energy through the catalytic activity of microorganisms. It is engineered to integrate an MFC system into a practical lamp powered by an average family's organic waste.</p>
                    <p>The lamp was developed using **optimal MFC conditions**, including compost aged 12-18 months, a 1-Liter container, and carbon cloth electrodes spaced at 1 cm. It features a **custom-built step-up DC converter** and battery storage system to store the generated energy and power a 9V LED lightbulb.</p>
                    <p>This design makes small MFCs a sustainable, cost-effective lighting solution for households.</p>
